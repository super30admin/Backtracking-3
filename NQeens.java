//Accepted on leetcode after several attempts
//Was able to understand the question and partly the intuition in general but was stuck while attempting to code myself. 
//Had to refer to a few solutions to see how to break my problems into parts and do it
//This was the only solution I could come up myself even though it is not optimal!
