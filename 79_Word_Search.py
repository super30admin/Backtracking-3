# Time Complexity : O(m * n * 3^l)[m = num of rows, n = num of cols, l = length of word]
# Space Complexity : O(m * n)[m = num of rows, n = num of cols]
# Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
# Any problem you faced while coding this : No

# Problem Approach(DFS + backtracking)
# 1. Traverse over the board in DFS manner and compare the char in word at each step
# 2. If the current char from board matches the char in word, proceed to the next char
# 3. If the current char from board does not match, backtrack and explore other directions
