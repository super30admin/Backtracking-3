FAQ-Why no BFS? In BFS, once the element is out, it's out from the queue, so we can't backtrack the path.
Can it be done without backtracking? No, since we could go back to the parent neighbor and our DFS will go in infinite
recursion.


Given an m x n grid of characters board and a string word, return true if word exists in the grid.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or
vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.



Example 1:
Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCCED"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "SEE"
Output: true

Example 3:
Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCB"
Output: false


Constraints:
m == board.length
n = board[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 6
1 <= word.length <= 15
board and word consists of only lowercase and uppercase English letters.

    """
    Ideation- DFS w/ backtracking (mark visited inplace), TC- O(permutation path * mn (for traversal)), SC- O(1)

    The idea is to explore all possible permutation paths that starts with first char of word.
    We prune the permutation path branch if the current char in word doesn't match the neighbor or if the node is
    already visited to avoid any loops in our recursion.
    We also prune recursion if the word was found in one of the DFS by our found flag.
    To account visited nodes, we can either do in place replacement in board or maintain an m*n visited matrix.
    Make sure to maintain the original state of the board and visited when the path does not work, and we backtrack.
