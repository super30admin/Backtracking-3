Approach: DFS with Backtracking
TC O(mn x 3^L) - mn for matrix traversal and 3^L where L is word len and 3 is number of choices we will have at each step when we are looking at neighbors
as one of the nodes will already be visited. So only initially we will have 4 choices for the 2nd letter, in the word we are searching for.
SC O(mn) if we had to use separate visited array, but we don't do that so it becomes O(1) and O(L) is recursive stack 
space as we will go at most L levels of DFS call
